Convincing your client on investing in continuous, real-device testing can be quite tedious. 'What do you mean we need testing budget; can't you just code it right?' is a common perception on the paying end of the table. 

You might say it's impossible to explain the problem to a total development noob, who is looking for a bargain...but it's not! And if we don't get around this fucking problem soon, the web and our work will continue to suffer; or, we will continue to give in and do the important part in our free time. 

Help yourself and the greater good and join me in sharing and completing an ultimate guide to convince the uninformed!

For now, just file an issue to post an idea or question. If you have any relevant materials, if it be video, imagery, code, whatever helps, PR away. This place is going to be in a better order very soon, thanks for your patience!
